\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
This document describes the basic structure of the Blue Jay project.
The primary goal is to clearly describe the design of the project,
and begin laying out the groundwork for how the system will be laid out
in the future.
\end{abstract}



\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter covers the basic knowledge needed to understand our project.

\section{Purpose of the System}
The Blue Jay system is a social media application,
remniniscent of twitter and reddit. It shares some of its
core functionality withe such systems, namely the ability for users
to create posts, reply to posts, browse posts, and view posts.


\section{Scope of the System}
The system is meant to be a simplified version of a social media platform.
Users can create posts, which will be publicly viewable by all other users.
Users can view posts, and from viewing posts reply to posts with their own
posts.
Users can access posts through browsing through recent posts, searching
through posts, or from the home page.

\section{Hardware and Software Requirements}

This section covers, what tools will be necessary
Not many special tools will be needed for running this project.
The following software is necessary for this project:
\begin{description}
\item [MySQL or PostgreSQL] Necessary for storing posts and user data,
precise version still undetermined at this point.
\item [Apache Server v2.4] Necessary for running of the site itself,
providing the ability to generate content through php scripts.
\item [Googe Chrome 77.0.+] Used for accessing website content during testing.
\item [Ubuntu 18.04] Used as host operating system for Apache and SQL server.
\end{description}

Hardware may or may not be outsourced to a cloud solution in the future,
but the minimum specs we expect to need are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Dual Core 2GHz or above processor.
\item 4 gibibytes of ram.
\item Ethernet connection to the internet, with speeds at or above 300 mbps.
\end{itemize}
