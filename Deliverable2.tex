\begin{abstract}
There are many ways for people to communicate with others, and social media is no exception. However, many of the existing platforms provide limited security, causing thousands of sensitive information to be leaked. Even with existing forms of security in place, the current methods vary from platform to platform, with the most well-known social media sites generally having the weakest levels of encryption, or none. BlueJay is a social platform for users to safely and securely post and share content over the internet using post sanitization, SSL encryption, password encryption, and other forms of user security. It takes the free-form posting of reddit and the social comforts of twitter to bring the same feeling of sharing content in a more secure setting.\\
This document will detail all the functional and non-functional requirements, subsystems, and architectural and design patterns used to implement BlueJay. The UML models displayed in the document were generated using StarUML. The security protocols used to protect BlueJay include email verification, forget password and login and out. The architectural patterns in the package diagram were the Model View Controller and the Three Tier.  The design patterns used were the Template, Façade and Mediator. The major subsystem in the package diagram are Client, Logic and Database.\\

\chapter{Introduction}
	This chapter will introduce the purpose of BlueJay (BJ), the functional and non-functional requirements of the use cases implemented. The software process model used will be identified along with the UML models that will be shown in the document.
\section{Purpose of system}
	Social media is a constant part of everyday life. People use it to stay in touch with their friends and family and to display their interests to the world, but far too often social media companies have been lapsing in protecting their users’ information.\\
	BlueJay (BJ) allows users to post text and images in a safe and secure manner to reduce the leaking of sensitive information, which can lead to fraud and identity theft. This will be done using many existing security techniques, such as password encryption, SSL encryption, and other safety measures that encourage users to prioritize securing their data.
\section{Requirements}
	\subsection{Functional requirements}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The system will allow users to create an account (see use case BJ015 – Account Creation in Appendix B).\\
		\item The system will allow users to create and upload posts (see use case BJ004 – Create Post in Appendix B).\\
		\item The will allow users to reply to a post (see use case BJ006 – Reply to Post in Appendix B).\\
		\item The system will allow users to view posts on the site (see use case BJ002 – View Post in Appendix B).\\
		\item The system will allow users to browse most recent popular post (see use case BJ001 – Browse Post in Appendix B)\\
		\item The system will make users go through a process to access their account (see use case BJ021 – Login in Appendix B).\\
		\item The system will allow users to exit their accounts (see use case BJ022 – Logout in Appendix B).\\
		\item The system will allow users to go through a process to access their account if they forget their password (see use case BJS005 – Forgot Password in Appendix B).\\
		\item The system will make users go through a process to get their password by answering 3 security questions (see use case BJS006 – Security Questions in Appendix B).\\
		\item The system will send users an email asking them to verify their account (see use case BJS007 – Email Verification in Appendix B).\\
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
	Usability: \\
		a.	All use cases require no actual training to use. While some use cases will be confusing for first time social media users, (BJ)’s user interactions follow well known practices seen on other social media sites.\\
		b.	Some though take an average of 2 minutes to familiarize with (see use cases BJ001 - Browse Post, BJ002 - View Post, BJ004 - Create Post, BJS005 - Forgot Password and BJS006 - Security Questions in Appendix B). \\
	Reliability: \\
		a.	All use cases have a consistent mean time to failure of 5 percent every 48 hours.\\
		b.	Some use cases should only allow for failure during a system maintenance (see use cases BJ021 - Login, BJ022 - Log out, BJS006 - Security Questions and BJS007 - Email Verification in Appendix B).\\
	Performance:\\ 
		a.	All use cases should have a maximum response time less than or equal to one second.\\
	Supportability: \\
		a.	All use case should be supported by browsers across multiple desktop and mobile devices.\\
	Frequency:\\
		a.	The average SM User will create and browse post around 30 times a day (see use cases BJ001 - Browse Post and BJ004 - Create Post in Appendix B).\\
		b.	The average SM User will view and reply to posts around 50 times a day (see use cases BJ002 - View Post and BJ006 - Reply to Post).\\
		c.	The average SM User will login and log out at most 15 times per day (see use cases BJ021 - Login and BJ022 - Log out in Appendix B).\\
		d.	Some use cases will only be used once (see use cases BJ015 - Account Creation, BJS005 - Forgot Password, BJS006 - Security Questions and BJS007 - Email Verification in Appendix B).\\
\section{Design methodology used} 
	The Unified Software Development Process model was used. The package, use case, deployment, ER, class, sequence and state machine diagram were used to represent the design.

\section{Overview of document}
	Chapter 2 will cover the software architecture such as the architectural patterns used. Chapter 3 will cover the diagrams used to represents the subsystems. Chapters 4 to 7 will be about the glossary, team signatures, references and appendices respectively.
\chapter{Proposed Software Architecture}
	This chapter will introduce the architectural patterns and detail the major subsystems used in the package diagram. Persistent data and the security protocols that were implemented will also be outlined.
\section{Overview}
	MVC was used because the client needs to modify its view; so, it requests the controller which generates a new model or a portion of a model it can send back over to view.\\
	Three Tier was used because

	Database\\
\section{Security Management}
BlueJay prides itself on its security, to ensure this various security protocols were implemented to protect unauthorized access to SM user’s accounts. These protocols include email verification, security questions and password recovery. With email verification when a SM user creates an account, they must provide an validate email address that is not being used by another account to activate their account. To access their account a user must log into by providing their username and password. In the off chance that user forgets their password they will be able to recover and change their old password by answering two questions they had previously set up and will have end when an email is sent to them.\\

\chapter{Detailed Design}
This chapter will introduce minimal class diagram for the subsystems and explain the purpose of each class. Along with the minimal class diagram this chapter will display the state machine and refined sequence diagrams. The design patterns used and the class sections that contain the OCL statements will be identified.\\

\chapter{Glossary}
BlueJay: BlueJay (BJ) is a social media platform that allows users to post texts and images in a safe and secure environment.\\
StarUML: StarUML is a software tool used to create UML diagrams.\\
SM User: Social media user; the user who is logged into the system.\\
MVC: Model View Controller is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.\\
Three Tier: Three-tier architecture is a client-server software architecture pattern in which the user interface (presentation), functional process logic ("business rules"), computer data storage and data access are developed and maintained as independent modules, most often on separate platforms.\\
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.\\
